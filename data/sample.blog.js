I have been resident in the US for over 16 years now, and the time here will soon eclipse the time that I spent growing up in England. At first I hung tightly to my British-ness. It is hard not to when you are an ex-pat. In many ways I felt *more* British being away from the motherland. You become the token, and get all of the questions and weird looks at your funny accent.<\/p>\n<p>Over time I dropped the <em>mate<\/em> for <em>dude<\/em>, and even switched from <em>colour<\/em> to <em>color<\/em>. Who am I kidding. My wife and children are American. My parents and brother have become American. I find myself in a bit of a weird place, being in between. I don&#8217;t fully feel &#8220;at home&#8221; here, but no longer feel at home when I find myself back in blighty. It isn&#8217;t the place that I grew up, and I wasn&#8217;t there to roll with the changes.<\/p>\n<p>I have had a green card for a long time, and should have gotten my citizenship awhile back, if not just to be able to vote against the likes of George Bush. But, something held me back.<\/p>\n<p>Then I looked at my young children and knew it was time, so I applied and went through the crazy experience of naturalization. First time around I randomly got a &#8220;DENIED&#8221; letter which ended up being because something didn&#8217;t come in the mail to me, so I had to start from scratch (and pay again! Thanks fellow citizens!).<\/p>\n<p>You are required to learn some simple civics as part of the process. The kind of questions that on the face of it you will nail without any study. Fortunately, my father-in-law has given me quite the civics lesson over time, and it is primarily due to he that I have been proud to take this step.<\/p>\n<p>You see, I often poo-poo&#8217;d America. This baby country that has more conservative areas than I would personally like. I don&#8217;t like the role as World Police. I think that recent wars have been criminal. But with all that being said, look at how fantastic it is that I can criticize her. This blog isn&#8217;t censored. In fact, it is now my <em>responsibility<\/em> to take care of her.<\/p>\n<p>Take this (from the oath that I just offered):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and <b>domestic<\/b>.&#8221;\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Domestic, not just foreign. This country is young and has a lot of growing up to do, but at the same time, it offers me a chance to become younger again too.<\/p>\n<p>My full oath is below:<\/p>\n<blockquote cite=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oath_of_Allegiance_(United_States)\"><p>\n&#8220;I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wordnik.com\/words\/potentate\" title=\"One who has the power and position to rule over others; a monarch... I knew you didn't know!\">potentate<\/a>, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and <b>defend the Constitution<\/b> and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.&#8221;\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is really quite fantastic that you are executing an oath to the Constitutional ideals and not a President, or Monarch. On that note, I looked up what a Dion in a parallel universe, who moved to the UK from the US, would be saying today upon joining the United Kingdom as a citizen:<\/p>\n<blockquote cite=\"http:\/\/www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk\/britishcitizenship\/applying\/ceremony\/\"><p>\n&#8220;I (name) swear by Almighty God that on becoming a British citizen, I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, her Heirs and Successors, according to law.&#8221;\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s right. You are swearing your allegiance to Queenie still!<\/p>\n<p>One thing I did like though was the note:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;You can make an affirmation if you prefer not to swear by God.&#8221;\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I appreciate that, and wish that I didn&#8217;t have to use that term so much in my ceremony today. It undermines my oath since if I don&#8217;t believe in Him, am I really able to take the oath?<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/paramount-theatre-oakland.jpg\" alt=\"paramount-theatre-oakland\" title=\"paramount-theatre-oakland\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2916\" style=\"float:right;padding:8px;\"><\/p>\n<p>The ceremony itself beat my expectations. It was held at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.paramounttheatre.com\/\">Paramount Theatre<\/a> in Oakland (they made me pledge allegiance to the Oakland Raiders too! :), and the chap running the show was funny! He welcomed people in 8 languages&#8230;. very impressive indeed. He was incredibly respectful of all countries, and there wasn&#8217;t even a hint of &#8220;you have joined the most amazing country! you were so smart to leave any other!&#8221; and instead the already mentioned respect for countries all over the world. There were over 1300 people present, from 106 countries, some of which I had never heard of, and others that do not exist anymore. Barack Obama said a few words (recorded of course), and I was thankful that I waited for his welcome rather than a predecessor.<\/p>\n<p>I now look forward to adding to the melting pot, and hope to be a bridge between the yanks and the chaps.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to my fellows from both countries that I adore.<\/p>",

What jumps out at me?<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/360-web-browser-awesome-feature\/id387737097?mt=8\"><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/browser360.png\" alt=\"browser360\" title=\"browser360\" width=\"525\" height=\"788\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2911\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My favorite is probably the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/360-web-browser-awesome-feature\/id387737097?mt=8\">360 Browser<\/a> from Saloni Srivastava. It packs a lot of fun features into a small device sized package, even if the UI feels a little foreign sometimes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The pie menu approach brought a smile (we experimented with a <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/bespin-gives-you-some-pie-and-will-do-more-web-work-for-you\">pie menu in Bespin<\/a>). There are two modes: drag and tap. With the default drag mode you end up holding a digit down on the screen and moving around. In practice I found this approach wanting because I would either hide the menu that I was aiming for, or I would move off and the menu would disappear. I prefer the tap approach, but actually wish for a solution that mixed the two&#8230; specifically, in tap mode I want to be able to hold down on a menu item and have a tooltip tell me what I am dealing with&#8230;. important as you learn the system.\n<li>Firefox Sync support is fantastic. I wish that I could tie in syncing from other browsers too and unify things.\n<li>In the top left of the toolbar you can quickly tap to make the current tab private&#8230;&#8230; something that many users will enjoy ;)\n<li>Tab support in general is good, and you can quickly show and hide them\n<li>Which leads into full screen support\n<li>The plugin system allows you to bring in a lot more to the experience. It feels a bit clunky, going into the plugins area and tapping on the item even though it has an [x] on it etc, but it great to be able to extend your browsing.\n<\/ul>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/sleipnir-mobile-web-browser\/id404732112?mt=8\"><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/browsersleipnir.png\" alt=\"browsersleipnir\" title=\"browsersleipnir\" width=\"525\" height=\"788\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2910\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/sleipnir-mobile-web-browser\/id404732112?mt=8\">Sleipnir Mobile<\/a> innovates nicely with tabs and somewhat with tagging and bookmarking. Being able to setup various &#8220;workspaces&#8221; for your tabs is very useful. I find myself wanting to keep a copy of sites like TechMeme, Hacker News, and others, and being able to put them in one tab group is fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/skyfire-web-browser\/id384941497?mt=8&#038;ign-mpt=uo%3D2\"><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/browserskyfire.png\" alt=\"browserskyfire\" title=\"browserskyfire\" width=\"525\" height=\"788\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2912\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/skyfire-web-browser\/id384941497?mt=8&#038;ign-mpt=uo%3D2\">Skyfire<\/a> has both an iPhone and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/skyfire-web-browser-for-ipad\/id409153623?mt=8\">iPad<\/a> version of their browser. Most talk about their support for Flash video, but they also have other interesting features such as their &#8220;quick views&#8221; which give you a taste of Twitter or Facebook without having to jump away from your current browsing stream. I am not the kind of chap who is looking for &#8220;related&#8221; exploration, but others probably are. It is also interesting to see how browsers get around limitations of the app-centric model. For example, Skyfire is aware of the clipboard and sucks in URLs, since you can&#8217;t send a URL to open that browser, or have a system-wide setting for &#8220;default browser&#8221;. We have similar issues with bookmarks. I want one central store that they can all use (others would like separation).<\/p>\n<p>In general, features such as private browsing, better tab management, and also caching itself can be huge. It drives me bonkers to hit the back button and have to wait for a page to be reloaded when I just came from there. I would happily give up a lot more hard drive space on my device to the browser. The feel of the browser is important too. If the scrolling is off, or the gestures? Ugh. I had that experience with Opera when it first came out. By default pages were zoomed so far out that it was unreadable and the pinch\/zoom felt wrong.<\/p>\n<p>I really hope that the exploration that is happening in the mobile browser space (and the money that some folks are making off of it!) keeps going, and that Apple opens up their terms to allow for a full Firefox experience and others.<\/p>\n<p>What would you like to see on a mobile browser?<\/p>",

They showed us various UI experiments and it was beautiful to see. The UI is slick and modern, and every effect is using CSS transition goodness, nicely hardware accelerated thanks to the PS3&#8217;s GPU.<\/p>\n<p>At first it may seem a bit crazy that the team took Qt\/WebKit with them as the rendering platform, but when you think about the huge number of devices that Netflix needs to support, it makes &#8220;wanting an iPhone and Android app&#8221; seem like laughable fragmentation.<\/p>\n<p><b>#2: Trusting the implementations to catch up?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We have amazing browsers in modern devices. But as we push the Web forward, we are still facing buggy implementations and varying support. Although WebKit lives within Mobile Safari, that doesn&#8217;t mean that Mobile Safari has open sourced everything to WebKit. The touch support isn&#8217;t there. We can&#8217;t all use the same scrolling effects and the like. That has to be built up by everyone.<\/p>\n<p>Ideally, with position:fixed (now in Android), you could use that and even flexbox to use the core scrolling of the browser itself so you don&#8217;t have to resort in the mimicry that frameworks have had to do until now.<\/p>\n<p>Even the magical escape chute to the GPU via CSS3D isn&#8217;t a silver bullet. <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/m.madebycanvas.com\/\"><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/matthewfarag.png\" alt=\"matthew farag\" title=\"matthew farag\" width=\"525\" height=\"408\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2906\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Matthew Farag has a lovely <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/m.madebycanvas.com\/\">portfolio site<\/a> that uses the power of this modern goodness (using Scripty2 for auto hardware acceleration!). Works great on a desktop WebKit, but how about the iPad? It does pretty well, but you start to see some of the buggy issues where the GPU seems to run out of memory and you get weird artifacts.<\/p>\n<p>So, when you put these two together, you realize that it could be nice to carry a great consistent Web runtime with you to allow you to get great experiences, especially while we are transitioning and getting everything flushed out. It would also enable us not to be beholden to the likes of Android and Apple to make sure that their Web runtimes are fantastic.<\/p>\n<p>I may want Chrome Frame for devices more than I care about it on the desktop as it turns out. Hmm. Alex? ;)<\/p>",

Some talk about how it is doing the &#8220;Microsoft thing&#8221; by setting up an internal competition, and Google is big enough to do that kind of thing.<\/p>\n<p>There were many who saw that &#8220;the Web will eventually win&#8221;, but as Android&#8217;s numbers get larger and larger, others are pondering things. Is the timing off? Has Android gotten too large to let itself lose to Chrome OS? Is the app ecosystem for Chrome OS not up to snuff with Android (let alone iOS)?<\/p>\n<p>If Google pulled the plug on Chrome OS it would feel like a bad day for the Web. Chrome OS needs push the entire Web forward. Chrome is adding features to WebKit and Chromium at a very healthy rate, and the Chrome OS pieces make sure that features that flush out the Web to rival native environments come along. Without the Chrome OS project being part of the whole Chrome ecosystem, that may not quite be the case.<\/p>\n<p>There are some projects that Google should go long on, and some that should be experiments. You could argue that Wave was an experiment that didn&#8217;t warrant continued evolution, but Chrome OS should. It moves the Web forward.<\/p>\n<p>The Web has a lot of huge benefits, but it is still hard at it going up against iOS, Android, and others. We need a lot of investment to give the Web the SDK that developers are striving for, so they can deliver compelling experiences. We aren&#8217;t there yet.<\/p>\n<p>With Google and Chrome OS, HP and webOS, and even a lot of other players (e.g. RIM and its Web support, Nokia and its, etc etc) we are seeing a healthy double-take on taking the Web forward and making the next big platform truly multi-vendor.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Merging&#8221; with Android is interesting. Android&#8217;s web stack has gotten better recently, but it is very much lacking, and you could argue that getting the Chrome\/WebKit talent and putting it on the Android stack could do a lot for the Web, and maybe bring the Web up to be a true Android platform. That could be a good thing, but would it ever truly be a first class citizen compared to the &#8220;Java but not really Java&#8221; stack?<\/p>\n<p>I truly hope that Google double downs on Chrome and Chrome OS, and gives it time to have the Web come along for the next ride as more than the ghetto that some would like to see it become.<\/p>\n<p>If not, time for Mozilla to create a Web OS :)<\/p>",

            "content:encoded": "<p>At least in terms of cool Web stuff, JSON replaced XML long ago. But the story keeps trickling down. Semi-pivotal events appear to be recent moves by Twitter and Foursquare to remove XML support from their Web APIs, settling solely on JSON. In the wake, no less than XML crew member James Clark has taken a slightly more appreciative stance on JSON. XML grew too complex, he admits. It doesn\u2019t work well with programming language data structures, he concedes. Still, the occasion is also an occasion for some equivocating, or whimsy. He wonders if there is a place for XML in the brave new Web world of the future.<\/p>\n<p>Writes James Clark:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2026 I think the Web community has spoken, and it&#8217;s clear that what it wants is HTML5, JavaScript and JSON. XML isn&#8217;t going away but I see it being less and less a Web technology; it won&#8217;t be something that you send over the wire on the public Web, but just one of many technologies that are used on the server to manage and generate what you do send over the wire.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>And he continues:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2026In the short-term, I think the challenge is how to make HTML5 play more nicely with XML. In the longer term, I think the challenge is how to use our collective experience from building the XML stack to create technologies that work natively with HTML, JSON and JavaScript, and that bring to the broader Web developer community some of the good aspects of the modern XML development experience.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.jclark.com\/2010\/11\/xml-vs-web_24.html\">XML vs the Web<\/a> \u2013 Clark&#8217;s Random Thoughts blog<\/p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?a=15m0m8kifI4:dmoOAq-TK-M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"><\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?a=15m0m8kifI4:dmoOAq-TK-M:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"><\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?a=15m0m8kifI4:dmoOAq-TK-M:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?i=15m0m8kifI4:dmoOAq-TK-M:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"><\/a>\n<\/div>",

That team worked tirelessly for many years to try to get the look and feels to be as exacting to their hosts as possible. A pixel off here and there&#8230;. and it felt wrong.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that this probably wasn&#8217;t the right approach, and either a) Use SWT to use the real OS components or b) create a great looking l&#038;f that is different to any one host, but natural and fantastic to use. Ben, Jasper Potts, and others fought for such a look and feel in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/java.dzone.com\/articles\/swing-looks-great-part-iii\">Nimbus<\/a> but a lot of time had gone by.<\/p>\n<p>We have all seen many platforms on top of hosts that don&#8217;t feel right and don&#8217;t look good. That doesn&#8217;t mean that cross platform can&#8217;t work. Flash is an example that is very much cross platform and that community very much went the &#8220;every app will have its own UI&#8221;&#8230;. probably TOO far in the other direction ;)<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the Web itself is a fantastic cross platform success. We have argued that if it wasn&#8217;t for the massive Web revolution, would non-Microsoft vendors (read: Mac OS X) be in the situation there are now? Or would they have followed in the wake of Atari, Amiga and BeOS? When the Web happened, suddenly the interesting actions that people wanted to do on a computer were dominated by the global scale of the Web (Google, Amazon, Yahoo!, eBay, etc). The Microsoft Office lock-in was gone (aside: it also DID help a lot that Microsoft gave Apple money, got Office over there, and solutions like VMWare enabled those few Windows apps that you still wanted to come with you).<\/p>\n<p>The Web was a great cross platform success, even though its rich capabilities in the areas of graphics were laughable&#8230;. as I mentioned in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/urls-are-special-where-the-web-beats-native\">an earlier post<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/*\/http:\/\/apple.com\"><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/oldandnew.apple.png\" alt=\"Apple - old and new\" title=\"apple old and new\" width=\"525\" height=\"246\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2869\"><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\nWhen you look back at many of the earlier designs of the top website brands, they are comical by todays standards. However, at this same time, technology such as WPF was being touted on the desktop. Why would people visit Web sites when they could experience amazing native Windows and Macintosh experiences?\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, I don&#8217;t think you can discount the Web on the merits of &#8220;cross platform can&#8217;t win&#8221; as it already did win once, and at a time when the capability gap was much wider than we now have with HTML5.<\/p>\n<p><b>Compare this native app to their Web site!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/delta-casestudy1.png\" alt=\"delta-casestudy1\" title=\"delta-casestudy1\" width=\"525\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2892\"><\/p>\n<p>I teased about the Delta mobile Web application before. If you compare their iPhone application to what you get if you go through a mobile browser, the difference is huge.<\/p>\n<p>But, is the reason they are so different due to capability? I think not. I think the reason is much more about structure, legacy, politics, and history reasons.<\/p>\n<p>I remember seeing an early viewing of an Adobe AIR eBay client. The thing was so rich, so much better than the awful eBay site in almost every way. It made you want to cry looking at the website afterwards. Why or why would eBay have this fantastic client and not spend time on the website where all their customers were! It wasn&#8217;t that they were baffoons, it was because they had no legacy in this new world! <\/p>\n<p>The designers had free rein with a blank sheet of paper. They had core concepts and some design language, but total creative freedom. Compare that to the website. If they changed the color one hex value users would go nuts! Every time Facebook changes their site there is a massive campaign to change it back for the first 2 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>They also didn&#8217;t have to run the gauntlet of the massive codebase that had been built over years to make any of these changes. And the QA. Ugh.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, an entirely new team could be formed to do this work.<\/p>\n<p>This is exactly what I am seeing in mobile. In many companies, if there is a mobile group, they are just that&#8230;. a very separate group. In a non-mobile-thinking company they are like the old &#8220;Mac&#8221; group in a Windows heavy shop that hangs in the corner and is very different.<\/p>\n<p>Other companies are still getting into the world of mobile and realizing that usage patterns are going in that direction. They are bringing in consultants to help out. They are forming new crack teams to take on the challenge. They are realizing that they need to re-think the entire experience, and hopefully realizing that they need to create software as-a-whole in a very different manner.<\/p>\n<p>The bar on the quality of experiences on some of the mobile platforms is very high indeed (and very low on others!) which has the (great) effect of pushing the bar forward.<\/p>\n<p>Will this leave the Web versions behind? Maybe in the short term. Kinda like how the old Twitter website was simple compared to Tweetie and other clients, but #newtwitter is much richer and borrows some of the concepts where they make sense.<\/p>\n<p>I am definitely seeing people swing back to their web experiences. As multiple platforms foster in touch and cross device, they are starting to feel the increasing tax of building totally different applications across the fragmentation, and then trying to keep them in sync once the 1.0 is complete. Outsourcing the 1.0 is one thing, but the syncing part is hard.<\/p>\n<p>Back to Delta. You will notice that the screenshots on the web side get increasingly poor as you go deeper into the experience. Contrast that with the iPhone version above that is always at a high quality. It is time for them to go back to the web side and sync up.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, just before a recent talk, we coded up some of the simple transitions and feel just so show how easy it is to get some of this stuff working via the mobile Web. You can see the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/downloads\/delta-case-study\">simple example here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In our Palm Developer Day keynote we shared some of the high level pieces on how to put this all together, the major piece being that you have to really re-think the way that you architect your applications (think: Gmail not server generated HTML, Backbone.js, and more).<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the slides:<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/delta-casestudy2.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/delta-casestudy2.png\" alt=\"delta-casestudy2\" title=\"delta-casestudy2\" width=\"525\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2892\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/delta-casestudy3.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/delta-casestudy3.png\" alt=\"delta-casestudy3\" title=\"delta-casestudy3\" width=\"525\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2892\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/delta-casestudy4.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/delta-casestudy4.png\" alt=\"delta-casestudy4\" title=\"delta-casestudy4\" width=\"525\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2892\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/delta-casestudy5.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/almaer.com\/blog\/uploads\/delta-casestudy5.png\" alt=\"delta-casestudy5\" title=\"delta-casestudy5\" width=\"525\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2892\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>aside<\/em>: Dave Balmer goes into some depth in his <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VaN1qzydHFM\">Rockstar apps with HTML5<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QAYBEJKhyWk\">talks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it isn&#8217;t all hunky dory. There are still edge cases on getting things performing just right using the Web on the various devices. You have to think &#8220;cross platform&#8221; again. It may have been nice to ignore that and hack on a native application for awhile. But, would you rather be porting between proprietary SDKs and languages all day long? Or re-use as much of your code as possible.<\/p>\n<p>And, if for some valid reason you really DO need a bit of native for something, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phonegap.com\/\">you<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.appcelerator.com\/\">can<\/a> break out of jail and do just that. The escape chute is waiting for you.<\/p>\n<p>We have a long way to go on giving developers better access to native capabilities and tools to make building the next generation of apps more of a breeze, but it is doable right now (another aside: webOS kinda proves that right now as the native apps ARE Web apps!)<\/p>\n<p>I will finish with the interesting take from Venture Beat the other day on how<br \/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2010\/11\/08\/the-iphone-app-is-the-flash-homepage-of-2010\/\">the iPhone app is the Flash homepage of 2010<\/a>. They say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In the late 1990s, it was common for companies to spend $50,000 to $150,000 for a Flash homepage that looked like a beautiful brochure. However, they soon learned that Flash was cumbersome, slow to load, expensive to build, and hard to update, and moved on to HTML. Now only specialized, high-end sites are Flash only.<br \/>\nThe exact same thing has replayed itself on the iPhone. Companies have paid $50,000, $100,000, and more for an iPhone app. Now they have to keep the iPhone app in sync with their regular web site, and have to add additional native apps, each at a high price point, due to the hypergrowth of Android and newly viable platforms like Windows Phone 7\n<\/p><\/blockquote>",

Via the JSMentors mailing list you must not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insult other subscribers<\/li>\n<li>Post racism<\/li>\n<li>Spam publications<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So far it&#8217;s been working great and developers are getting the mentoring that they desperately want and need. And the great thing is that the mentors are a who&#8217;s-who of the JavaScript world. Check out this list:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Garrett Smith<\/li>\n<li>Juriy Zaytsev a.k.a. kangax<\/li>\n<li>Dmitry A. Soshnikov<\/li>\n<li>Steven Levithan<\/li>\n<li>John-David Dalton<\/li>\n<li>Stoyan Stefanov<\/li>\n<li>Benjamin Rosseaux a.k.a. BeRo<\/li>\n<li>Diego Perini<\/li>\n<li>Angus Croll<\/li>\n<li>Peter van der Zee<\/li>\n<li>Christian C. Salvad\u00f3<\/li>\n<li>Peter Michaux<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One important thing to note is that the main focus of the list is <strong>the JavaScript language<\/strong> and while you can post about JavaScript libraries, you&#8217;re more likely to get a better answer in a library&#8217;s specific support forum or list than on JSMentors.com.<\/p>\n<p>Asen and I would like to invite developers to join <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/jsmentors.com\/\">JSMentors.com<\/a> and create a productive list to help everyone become better JavaScript developers and help push the web forward.<\/p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?a=3zSkpJzDU14:cLBGagGOxoM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"><\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?a=3zSkpJzDU14:cLBGagGOxoM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"><\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?a=3zSkpJzDU14:cLBGagGOxoM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/ajaxian?i=3zSkpJzDU14:cLBGagGOxoM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"><\/a>\n<\/div>",

            "content:encoded": "<p><\/p>\n<p>The Palm Developer Day in New York City was a ton of fun last weekend. Greg and the events team did a bang up job, and it was a pleasure to continue to hang out with the webOS community. Seeing old friends was great, and finally being able to put a face to a name or a nick was great too (highlighted by meeting Rod Whitby of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.webos-internals.org\/wiki\/Main_Page\">webOS internals<\/a>, all the way from down under!) This community sure is passionate.<\/p>\n<p>A strong thread throughout the show was the importance of cross platform solutions for developers. There was <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5D4_aiWxPYU\">great content such as a cross platform framework landscape review<\/a>, and PhoneGap, and a panel including the likes of Charles Jolly of Strobe\/SproutCore.<\/p>\n<p>The icing on the cake though was the coming out party for Enyo (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enyo\">greek goddess of War<\/a>), a next-generation touch UI framework from HP.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to understand where Enyo came from. A chap called Matt McNulty was one of the reasons why Ben and I joined Palm way-back-when. We had been working with him on a webOS-bespin hybrid which later became the fantastic <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ares.palm.com\/\">Ares<\/a> Web based IDE. The layout system is still best in breed, and being able to deploy from the Web to your phone is just awesome.<\/p>\n<p>Those in the Ajax community, especially Dojo old-timers wouldn&#8217;t have been surprised to see this level of polish and innovation. Scott and Steve <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sitepen.com\/blog\/2007\/09\/16\/the-dojo-grid\/\">created the grid that was donated to Dojo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The team behind Ares were not using the Mojo framework, but rather another one (Opus) that would morph into what we see with Enyo today. Going between an Ares application and a Mojo one has always had friction, but that will all be changed with The Unification happens. You will be able to go between the UI builder tool (Ares) and hand coding, no sweet.<\/p>\n<p>There are a bunch of modern touch UI frameworks these days: Sencha Touch, Sproutcore Touch, iAd JS (really!), jQuery Mobile, and more. I am excited about Enyo being added to this mix. Here is why:<\/p>\n<p><b>Performance<\/b><\/p>\n<p>This has been the number one goal, and I have seen the massive difference that it makes on webOS. Enyo based apps start incredibly quickly and stay smooth. This is an area that webOS needed to improve (performance) and Enyo makes huge strides (especially when you also add the work that the entire platform and apps teams have done). Fortunately a lot of the top frameworks are starting to do a really good job here. They are using similar tricks around: keeping a virtual tree and only going across the DOM boundary as little as possible, trying hard to keep animations and rendering on the GPU and without triggering re-renders whenever possible via CSS3 tricks.<\/p>\n<p><b>Developer productivity<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Ares developers have told us time and again how fun it is to write apps. It is very easy to get going, and this goes beyond the great tools. The Enyo framework itself has some fantastic developer ergonomics, especially around layout and the event design, which also helps make sure that you don&#8217;t leak memory (obviously a huge thing on mobile).<\/p>\n<p><b>Cross device<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Another major goal with Enyo is the fact that it has to deal with the number of devices coming out of HP running webOS in the future. This is huge, because a massive pain points for developers right now, and in the coming years even more so, will be the need to handle many resolutions, dimensions, and capabilities for the touch world. By solving this problem in a unique way, Enyo makes this a strength. Scott Miles (or as I call him, The Architect) showed off an email client that is in &#8220;phone&#8221; mode (list of emails) when in a narrow window, but as soon as it got big enough (say, a tablet size resolution) the layout changed in real-time to offer a different view. Being able to share views, and have magic components that can even do a lot of the work for you, is fantastic when you think of building applications that span mobile and tablet (and others). Beyond this though, what about Web apps? I have often said that I wish that I could run a Twitter app in an IM-like configuration (long thin view) looking like echofon\/Tweetie\/etc, but as soon as I maximise it or stretch it out, it uses that real-estate to become more like Twitter for iPad or TweetDeck. Enyo makes this very possible indeed. <\/p>\n<p><em>ASIDE<\/em>: I had a bit of fun with doing this manually with the &#8220;hello world&#8221; style site <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/setdirection.com\/\">setdirection.com<\/a> which changes between browser, mobile (including landscape and portrait).<\/p>\n<p><b>Cross platform<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Enyo is too good to be stuck on any one platform. I think that the folks behind webOS know this. Having a set of tools and framework like this available for the Web as a whole is going to add to the growing list of quality frameworks that are available for true touch applications (not just DOM sprinkling libraries).<\/p>\n<p>Having this discipline is also added by the fact that you can then spend most of your time developing in a browser rather than an emulator, and thus use all of the browser debugging tools that are available.<\/p>\n<p><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Firstly, congrats to Matt, Scott, Steve, and the entire team for showing us a glimpse of Enyo. I can&#8217;t wait to have developers play with it. Go Web.<\/p>\n<p>It is great to see not only <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.precentral.net\/preview-enyo-app-framework-webos\">PreCentral<\/a> grok its importance, but also <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2010\/11\/21\/palm-webos-enyo-framework-paves-the-way-for-tablets-and-larger\/\">Engadget<\/a> and others.<\/p>",

However, at this same time, technology such as WPF was being touted on the desktop. Why would people visit Web sites when they could experience amazing native Windows and Macintosh experiences?<\/p>\n<p>The Web is always behind (in some ways), almost by definition due to the fact that it is based on Open standards. When you look at what you can do with the Web today, it actually compares a lot more favorably to the native desktop experiences that it did back then!<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that the Web has some nice features and function. This isn&#8217;t about a ra-ra Web moment, but native folk should also use this as a way to make their platforms and applications better.<\/p>\n<p><b>URLs are amazing<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Web offers a shared platform. The glue that binds the Web together is hyperlinks. My Mum can put up a website and join the shared fabric instantly. Her work can be found on Google, shared on Facebook, and quickly forgotten about on Twitter. All without having to talk to ANYONE. No deals. No vendors. Silent. That is pretty amazing.<\/p>\n<p>Her work can join the shared stack as folks browse around the constantly changing event based Web. Not only can it be linked too, it can be embedded in various ways. The collective can all work on top of each others work in simple and interesting ways.<\/p>\n<p>This is very different to the app silos of iOS for example. webOS and Android are better in different ways, and have some hooks that allow you to mimic the behaviour. In webOS you can <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.palm.com\/blog\/2010\/09\/cross-app-api-implementation\/\">cross scene push actions between applications<\/a> and Android has a rich system of intents. Once you use these systems you wish you had them on the iOS&#8230;. e.g. being in an email, tapping on a link to go into a browser windows, and then going back to the email in a humane manner.<\/p>\n<p>The mobile Web can really shine here if we can get that experience up to snuff. This clicked for me after talking to Charles Jolley sometime about a SproutCore application and differences between serving the mobile app on http vs. via PhoneGap\/native app method.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say I have two native experiences installed on my iPad. Twitter for iPad, and the New York Times app. I am reading my Twitter feed and tap on a link to a nytimes URL. Ideally I may enjoy having the native experience take over, but it doesn&#8217;t as we are in silos. It would be nice if the native system would allow me to register a URL handler so the New York Times app could say &#8220;hey, if you see a nytimes URL, hand it to me and I can take care of it&#8221; (of course there are issues of preferences and choosing which app to launch etc).<\/p>\n<p>Now imagine that the Twitter and New York Times solutions were done using Web technology, and could run via http and natively. Now, when you share a nytimes URL with me, I get the FULL experience passed over to me.<\/p>\n<p><b>The Hackable Web<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The fact that the Web is so hackable is a true gift too. I talked about the fact that you can embed and compose cleanly. &#8220;Mashups&#8221; are really powerful. The Facebook platform is a mashup. I feel very empowered on the Web as I know that I can change things&#8230;. and small things can frustrate me. I want to see the name of someone on Twitter instead of their handle (&#8221;Frank Davis&#8221; means more to me than &#8220;fatgopher&#8221; for all but friends that I know well or who tweet so much that I learn quickly). Echofon drives me nuts in that I can&#8217;t change this setting as I can in Tweetie (although Tweetie is so behind that I suffer through on Echofon :\/).<\/p>\n<p>If this was a Web application I could greasemonkey \/ extension my way out. There is always a power tool in reach. The core developer doesn&#8217;t have to build out a &#8220;plugin API&#8221; for me, but if they care about not breaking me they CAN expose a nice API as the Gmail team did back in the day. You can trick out twitter.com in so many ways thanks to the userscripts that are out there, and whatever you want to write yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Now, this is far from mainstream. Sure, the good stuff can be wrapped up as a browser extension (and packaged together a la <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/lifehacker.com\/251923\/lifehacker-code-better-gmail-firefox-extension\">Better Gmail<\/a>), but I still feel like we have a ways to go to make it easier for people to trick out their experiences. If my Mum goes to Twitter she will never realise there are hundred of ways to change that experience.<\/p>\n<p>The Web has reach. You own your nodes (and can change what runs there at your convenience). It is still simple to get hacking on compared to most platforms (even if advanced things are hard) and remember: Distribution, distribution, distribution.<\/p>\n<p>As we all push the Web forward, I look to see how we close the gap even more so with the proprietary platforms, and how we continue to surpass them in ways too.<\/p>",
